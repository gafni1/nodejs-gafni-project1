        Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that
        aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while
        providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to
        spectators. <br> Sports can, through casual or organized participation,
        improve participants' physical health.<br> Hundreds of sports exist, from
        those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of
        simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals.<br>
        In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete,
        simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest
        (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.<br>
        Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner;
        others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser.
        A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a
        champion.<br> Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games
        in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.<br> Sport is
        generally recognised as system of activities based in physical
        athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the
        Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.<br> Other
        organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities
        without a physical element from classification as sports.<br> However, a
        number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as
        mind sports.<br> The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF)
        recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord,
        the international sports federation association, recognises five
        non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi,
        and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<br>
        Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to
        ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the
        winner.<br> Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring
        goals or crossing a line first.<br> It can also be determined by judges who
        are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or
        subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic
        impression.<br> Records of performance are often kept, and for popular
        sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport
        news.<br> Sport is also a major source of entertainment for
        non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport
        venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting.<br> Sport betting
        is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the
        sport.<br> According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting
        industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.<br> The world's most
        accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is
        the most popular spectator sport.
